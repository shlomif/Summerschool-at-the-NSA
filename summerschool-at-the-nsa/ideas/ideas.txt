    dust.
        - The crowd cheers.

* "You now must slay The Rider, the Vampirella with the oldest body ; the
Integrator, the Vampire with the same body and same soul ; and The Slayer,
the first vampire to have slain."

* "Only a Vampire can slay a vampire, and vampirellas are the most formidable
slayers."

* "Tell you what - I'm no longer The Slayer. I quit"

* The Guide gives Selina a gift in a fancy chest. The first compartment contains
a very stylised 1d10 die, and after opening the other compartment, she sees

    - They agree that she is right.
    - Someone suggests they do a group exercise.

        appreciate that and tries to turn it off.

        - they think for a moment and say then can do much better with
        the "smallest yet deadliest possible weapon a vampire warrior can have:
        the wooden toothpick."
        - Selina asks them if they have watched too much Sesame street:
            - the Three: “of course, every mighty Klingon warrior has watched
            Sesame Street”
            - Selina: “Mighty Klingon vampire warriors who have watched
            Sesame Street! This decade royally sucks!”
        - Selina: “fine, I don't care that you're going to slay yourself using
        toothpicks, despite claiming to be the greatest fighters in history -
        you brought it on yourself. Just do it here on the trail where no one
        will care about the dust from your bodies."
        - They slay themselves.
        - Selina gets a mobile phone call.
            - Selina: "oh, the usual, a good day for some ‘Klingons’ I
            met to die"
                - “I am glad you are amused.”
                - “BTW, I believe we can never truly appreciate Sesame Street
                until we have watched it in the original Klingon.”
                - Jessica laughs.

                - Selina: oh good, can I have a Jewish lady cat? I want one
