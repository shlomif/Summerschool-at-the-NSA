Hi all,

this video is a call for action about getting the screenplay
“Summerschool at the NSA” produced and filmed. It can be viewed online
here:

I first learned of the NSA in the film Sneakers (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_%281992_film%29 ), which I watched in
high school and enjoyed, where the NSA plays an unflattering role.

Shortly after high school, I was employed at several workplaces and then
during 1997 joined the Technion. 1996 was when the Internet and the Web 1.0
craze started, and everyone and their mother were looking for good tech workers.
Moreover, shortly after that, the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer ) started airing,
and became a big hit,
and many people became obsessed with it, and many Web 1.0 fan sites of the show,
and its lead actress, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar ,
sprang like mushrooms after the rain.

Now, Gellar’s first foray into the cinema was in the films I Know What You
did Last Summer, and Scream 2, which were cheesy and not so scary horror films,
which although successful, received negative critical reception.

During the summer of 1998, I was discussing the shortage of capable technical
workers in the software industry over E-mail with my friend, Omer Zak:

I told Omer: «Even the NSA doesn’t have enough programmers. But it is not
likely that they will have more, and that’s because Summerschool at the NSA
may might as well be the name of Sarah Michelle Gellar’s next movie.

To which he replied: «And as opposed to I Know What You Did Last Summer,
it is going to be scary.»

Many years later, following some inspiration from the Chuck Norris
factoids meme, I started to collect factoids deprecating the NSA:

http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/

Some sample ones are:

««

* The NSA don’t publish. They perish.

* The Bajoran scholars have positively identified
Benjamin Sisko as The Emissary. They also positively
identified the NSA headquarters as The Dungeon.

* One of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s episodes took place
in the NSA headquarters, but had to be destroyed, because
all of the test audience had uncontrollable panic attacks.

* The NSA knows what you did last summer. But no one, in
the NSA or outside it, knows why they should.

»»

And finally «First the NSA ignores “silly” Internet memes,
then they laugh at them, then they are unable to fight them,
and then they lose.».

As I became more and more obsessed with fighting the NSA, which is a
huge sink of time and money in the United States government, and which
doesn’t do any good due to their secretive and non-transparent nature,
I came up with the next step which was this open letter:

http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/smg-film/

«Open Letter to Ms. Sarah Michelle Gellar: Production of the
Documentary Film “Summerschool at the NSA”»

While not a lot came out of it directly, and I didn’t hear from
Ms. Gellar about it, it certainly got me thinking, and then as I
attended the Olamot Sci-Fi Fantasy conference (see
http://www.flickr.com/photos/shlomif/sets/72157633111982891/ ) which was
incredibly stimulating, I realised I could make a lot of headway without
needing Gellar’s cooperation and that I could write a fictional script
of my own about her seriously kicking the ass of these NSA losers. Hence:

Summerschool at the NSA - a Screenplay:
http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/

(Taglined: “As the sling shoots, grown men will cry”)

Reading from the abstract:

««

The Hollywood actresses Sarah Michelle Gellar (of Buffy fame) and Summer Glau
(of xkcd notability) conspire to kick the ass of the NSA (= the United States
government’s National Security Agency), while using special warfare that is
completely non-violent. Two attractive, intelligent, and resourceful, women
against a large, inefficient, federal government organisation whose estimated
annual budget is several times their combined worth.

Does the NSA actually stand a chance?

While it is highly fictional, and cuts many corners, it does illustrate
a point and consists of the theme of a person’s moral choice between
Publish or alternatively - Perish (
http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/2615.html ).

That's where you come in: please read it, spread the word (please use the "#SummerNSA" hash-tag), and try to work on creating audios and videos
out of it. For all I care, it can be an animation, or played by people resembling the
fictionalised versions of the two main protagonists. Moreover, its Creative
Commons CC-by licence allows close to any reuse, as long as I am given credit.

Let a thousand flowers bloom.

A lot of people think the Snowden revelations are real, but I believe a
large part of them are the products of minds with Manias, clinical
depressions or schizophrenia attacks, all of which I believe are now the
norm in the NSA, due to their secretive and paranoid, and
ergo - miserable - nature. And we shouldn't be paranoid about that - because
a paranoid person is unhappy and therefore - insecure.

The NSA is an organisation full of unhappy people who are afraid of their own
shadow, incompetent, and evil ones. It contributes **nothing** to the
well-being of Americans and the world at large, yet keep claiming the opposite
is the fact. While it taps to many unencrypted messages on the Internet, in
a vein and unfounded hope that it can reach genuine understanding, and spends
a lot of money on storage and computers, it is completely non-transparent
and won't publish anything of its conclusions.

Whoever wishes to work for the NSA must be in a state
of sin, as no one in his right mind will want to work for them, so they get
either the most irrational people, the most incompetent ones, or the most
evil ones (or usually - all three).
